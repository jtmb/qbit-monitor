### <h1>About</h1>

An Alpine-based microservice within Docker, designed to make forwarding vpn ports easy.

This solution proves invaluable for those who self-host torrents.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system

### <h2>Getting Started</h2>
### [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jtmb92/ez-backups)
```docker
 docker pull jtmb92/qbit-port-forwarder
```

### Running on Docker Compose  
Run on Docker Compose (this is the recommended way) by running the command "docker compose up -d".  
```yaml
services:
    qbit-port-forwarder:
        image: docker.io/jtmb92/qbit-port-forwarder
        container_name: qbit-port-forwarder
        environment:
            container_volumes_location: '/mnt'
            node: '192.168.0.5'
            ADMIN_USER: 'brajam'
            ADMIN_PASS: '${ADMIN_PASS}'
            WAIT_TIME: '1h'
        volumes:
         - ${container_volumes_location}/gluetun:/mnt/gluetun
```

## Environment Variables explained  

```yaml
    container_volumes_location: '/mnt'
```  
Location on the host machine where volumes will be mounted.  
```yaml
    node: '192.168.0.5'
```  
The IP address of the node you wish to connect to.  
```yaml
    ADMIN_USER: 'brajam'
```  
Admin username for the service.  
```yaml
    ADMIN_PASS: '${ADMIN_PASS}'
```  
Admin password for the service. This should be set as an environment variable or a `.env` file.  
```yaml
    WAIT_TIME: '1h'
```  
Time to wait before performing a port forward operation (can be set in hours, minutes, or seconds).  
```yaml
    volumes: 
        - ${container_volumes_location}/gluetun:/mnt/gluetun
```  
The path to mount the `gluetun` directory in the container.
