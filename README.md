### <h1>About ( What problem does this solve? )</h1>

This application enhances your qBittorrent experience with two powerful features:

1. **Torrent Monitoring & Discord Notifications**  
   Automatically monitors your qBittorrent for new and completed torrents, sending real-time notifications to your Discord channel. It also handles stuck torrents caused by metadata issues, keeping your downloads running smoothly.

2. **ProtonVPN Port Forwarding Integration**  
   If you're using the GluetenVPN container for ProtonVPN, you know the pain of random port assignments after each container restart. This application solves that problem by automatically checking the VPN-assigned forwarded port and updating your qBittorrent configuration accordingly.

---

### Features:
- Real-time torrent status notifications on Discord.
- Automatic resolution of metadata-stuck torrents.
- Seamless integration with ProtonVPN for dynamic port forwarding.
- Easy setup and lightweight operation.

Take your qBittorrent setup to the next level! ðŸš€

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system

### <h2>Getting Started</h2>
### [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jtmb92/qbit-monitor)
```docker
 docker pull jtmb92/qbit-monitor
```

> <span style="color:yellow;"> **Note:**</span> This container does not run as `root`. To ensure proper functionality, you must take ownership of the required directories on your host system and set the correct permissions before starting the container. For example:

```bash
username=$(whoami):
sudo chown $username:$username /mnt/qbit-monitor
sudo chmod 755 /mnt/qbit-monitor
```



### Running on Docker Compose  
Run on Docker Compose (this is the recommended way) by running the command "docker compose up -d".  
```yaml
services:
  qbit-monitor:
    image: docker.io/jtmb92/qbit-monitor
    container_name: qbit-monitor
    depends_on:
        qbittorrent:
            condition: service_started
            restart: true
    environment:
      DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL: your-discord-token-here
      QBITTORRENT_HOST: "http://qbittorrent:8112"
      QBITTORRENT_USERNAME: "admin"
      QBITTORRENT_PASSWORD: "admin1234"
      PORT_FORWARDING: "on"
      PORT_FORWARD_FILE: /mnt/gluetun/forwarded_port
      CHECK_INTERVAL_FORWARDED_PORT: 1h
      PORT_UPDATED_NOTIFICATION: "on"
      CHECK_INTERVAL_TORRENT_MONITORING: 10s
      NEW_DOWNLOAD_NOTIFICATION: "on"
      METADATA_STUCK_NOTIFICATION: "on"
      DOWNLOAD_COMPLETE_NOTIFICATION: "on"
      PUID: "1000"
      PGID: "1000"
    volumes:
      - /mnt/gluetun:/mnt/gluetun
      - /mnt/qbit-monitor:/app/state
```
