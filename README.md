### <h1>About ( What problem does this solve? )</h1>

Monitors your qBittorrent for new / completed torrents and notifies on discord, also handles qbittorrent meta data stuck torrents.

The GluetenVPN container allows for port forwarding with PROTONVPN with the unfortunate downside that PROTON assigns a random port everytime you restart your container. This application will check the vpn forewarded port and update your qbittorrent application automatically.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system

### <h2>Getting Started</h2>
### [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jtmb92/qbit-monitor)
```docker
 docker pull jtmb92/qbit-monitor
```

### Running on Docker Compose  
Run on Docker Compose (this is the recommended way) by running the command "docker compose up -d".  
```yaml
services:
